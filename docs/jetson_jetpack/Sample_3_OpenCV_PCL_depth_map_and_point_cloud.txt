The sample 3, to work with OpenCV and PCL to show depth map and point cloud obtained from ToF sensor, which requires ROS Kinetic or PCL as dependencies.

Prerequisites:

  Jetson TX2
  Jetpack 3.2
  ROS Kinetic or PCL

Before you start

  If you already have "ROS Kinetic" installed, jump to the section of "Build and run sample application". 
  
  If you do not have "ROS Kinetic" installed, you have options:
  
     1. install "ROS Kinetic" (refer to "Sample_2_ROS_depth_map_and_point_cloud.txt", section "Install ROS Kinetic") and jump to the section of "Build and run sample application".
     
     2. if you do not want "ROS Kinetic" to be installed for whatever reason, go to next step of "Install dependencies".
    
Install dependencies

  >> sudo apt-get update
  
  >> sudo apt install git build-essential cmake cmake-qt-gui doxygen mpi-default-dev openmpi-bin openmpi-common libflann1.8 libflann-dev libeigen3-dev libboost-all-dev libvtk6-dev libvtk6.2 libvtk6.2-qt libqhull-dev libusb-dev libgtest-dev freeglut3-dev pkg-config libxmu-dev libxi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev graphviz mono-complete libphonon-dev phonon-backend-vlc phonon-backend-gstreamer qt-sdk libopenni-dev libopenni2-dev libjpeg-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libv4l-dev x264 v4l-utils libgtk2.0-dev libproj-dev

Install PCL:
  
  ## Download PCL 1.8.1 source release from here: https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/archive/pcl-1.8.1.zip

  ## Extract the package into a directory (this guide use /home directory as an example). There should be: ~/pcl-pcl-1.8.1
    
  >> cd ~/pcl-pcl-1.8.1
   
  >> mkdir build
	
  >> cd build
	
  >> cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_examples=OFF ..
    
  >> make -j2
    
  >> sudo make install
  
Build and run the sample application:

1. Plug in the sensor, and set USB permission:

  >> sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0

2. Extract VSEMI_TOF_SDK archive into /home directory, there should be: ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK

3. Build sample desktop application:

  >> cd ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK/samples/sample3

  >> mkdir build && cd build

  >> cmake .. -DVSEMI_TARGET_PLATFORM=jetson_jetpack_3.0

  >> make

4. To start the sample desktop application, run command:

  >> cd ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK/samples/sample3/build

  >> ./vsemi_tof_cam

5. To stop the application, press Esc key when the depth map window active, or use mouse to close the point cloud window.
