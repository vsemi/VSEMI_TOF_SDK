Sample 6, to work with OpenCV to show depth map with minimum dependencies, no PCL required and no point cloud visualization.

Prerequisites:

  Jetson TX2
  Jetpack 3.2
  cmake 3.5 +
  boost 1.55 +
  
Before you start

  If you already have dependencies for any one of Sample1 or Sample2 or Sample3 installed, go to the section of "Build and run sample application", otherwise install dependencies refer to Sample_1_Quick_start_raw_data_minimum_dependency.txt.
  
Build and run sample application

1. Plug in the sensor, and set USB permission:

  >> sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0

2. Extract VSEMI_TOF_SDK.zip into /home directory, there should be: ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK

3. Build sample desktop application:

  >> cd ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK/samples/sample6

  >> mkdir build && cd build

  >> cmake .. -DVSEMI_TARGET_PLATFORM=jetson_jetpack_3.0

  >> make

4. To start the sample desktop application, run command:

  >> cd ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK/samples/sample6/build

  >> ./vsemi_tof_cam

5. To stop the application, press Esc key when the depth map window active, or use mouse to close the point cloud window.
