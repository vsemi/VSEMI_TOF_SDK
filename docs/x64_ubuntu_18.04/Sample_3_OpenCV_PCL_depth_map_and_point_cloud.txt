The sample 3, to work with OpenCV and PCL to show depth map and point cloud obtained from ToF sensor, which requires ROS Melodic or PCL as dependencies.

Prerequisites:

  x64
  ubuntu 18.04
  ROS Melodic

Before you start

  If you already have "ROS Melodic" installed, go to the section of "Build and run the sample application". 
  
  If you do not have "ROS Melodic" installed, you have options:
  
     1. install "ROS Melodic" (refer to "Sample_2_ROS_depth_map_and_point_cloud.txt", section "Install ROS Melodic") and jump to the section of "Build and run the sample application".
     
     2. if you do not want "ROS Melodic" to be installed for whatever reason, go to next step of "Install dependencies".
    
Install dependencies

  >> sudo apt-get update
  
  >> sudo apt install git build-essential doxygen mpi-default-dev openmpi-bin openmpi-common libflann-dev libeigen3-dev libboost-all-dev libvtk6-dev libqhull-dev libusb-dev libgtest-dev freeglut3-dev pkg-config libxmu-dev libxi-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev graphviz mono-complete libphonon-dev phonon-backend-vlc phonon-backend-gstreamer libopenni-dev libopenni2-dev libjpeg-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libv4l-dev x264 v4l-utils libgtk2.0-dev libproj-dev

Install PCL:
  
  ## Download PCL 1.8.1 source release from here: https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/archive/pcl-1.8.1.zip

  ## Extract the package into a directory (this guide use /home directory as an example). There should be: ~/pcl-pcl-1.8.1
    
  >> cd ~/pcl-pcl-1.8.1
   
  >> mkdir build && cd build
	
  >> cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_examples=OFF ..
    
  >> make -j2
    
  >> sudo make install

Install OpenCV

  ## Download OpenCV v4.1.1 source from here: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.1.1.zip

  ## Extract the package into a directory (this guide use /home directory as an example). There should be: ~/opencv-4.1.1

  ## Open a terminal and run following commands:

  >> cd ~/opencv-4.1.1
	
  >> mkdir build && cd build
    
  >> cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local .. -DBUILD_LIBPROTOBUF_FROM_SOURCES=ON -DENABLE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS=OFF
    
  >> make -j4
    
  >> sudo make install

Build and run the sample application

1. Plug in the sensor, and set USB permission:

  >> sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0

2. Extract VSEMI_TOF_SDK archive into /home directory, there should be: ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK

3. Build sample desktop application:

  >> cd ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK/samples/sample3

  >> mkdir build && cd build

  >> cmake .. -DVSEMI_TARGET_PLATFORM=x64_ubuntu_18.04

  >> make

4. To start the sample desktop application, run command:

  >> cd ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK/samples/sample3/build

  >> ./vsemi_tof_cam

5. To stop the application, press Esc key when the depth map window active, or use mouse to close the point cloud window.
