The sample 4, to work with ROS to show depth map and point cloud obtained from ToF sensor, and RGB color image from RGB camera, 
use this sample only if you have Vsemi ToF-Plus sensor, which with RGB camera. 

The sample requires ROS Kinetic as dependencies.

Prerequisites:

  Jetson TX2
  Jetpack 3.2
  ROS Kinetic

Before you start

  If you already have "ROS Kinetic" installed previously, go to the section of "Build and run sample application". 
  
  If you do not have "ROS Kinetic" installed, install "ROS Kinetic" (refer to "Sample_2_ROS_depth_map_and_point_cloud.txt", section "Install ROS Kinetic") and then go to the section of "Build and run sample application".
  
Build and run sample application:

1. Plug in the sensor, and set USB permission:

  >> sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0

2. Extract VSEMI_TOF_SDK archive into /home directory, there should be: ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK

3. Build sample ROS application, 

  >> cd ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK/samples/sample4

  ## make sure the file src/vsemi_tof_plus_cam/cfg/vsemi_tof_plus_cam.cfg has execute permission:

  >> sudo chmod a+rxw src/vsemi_tof_plus_cam/cfg/vsemi_tof_plus_cam.cfg

  >> catkin_make -DVSEMI_TARGET_PLATFORM=jetson_jetpack_3.0

4. To start the ROS sample application, run command:

  >> cd ~/VSEMI_TOF_SDK/samples/sample4

  ## If it is first time to run ROS sample, please make sure "run.sh" has execute permission:

  >> sudo chmod a+rxw run.sh

  ## Then run command to start ROS sample application:

  >> ./run.sh

5. To stop ROS, please press Ctr + C in terminal
